 * Ceed Ads Web SDK — Core Type Definitions
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This file centralizes all type definitions used
 * internally within the SDK. It does not contain any
 * logic. Keeping types isolated improves clarity,
 * reusability, and maintainability across modules.
 *
 * The types here align with the client-facing API responses
 * and request/event payloads. Firestore document schemas
 * are intentionally not exposed to the SDK.
