/**
 * @fileoverview Ceed Ads Web SDK — Core Type Definitions
 * @module types
 *
 * This file centralizes all type definitions used internally within the SDK.
 * It does not contain any logic. Keeping types isolated improves clarity,
 * reusability, and maintainability across modules.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The types here align with the client-facing API responses and request/event
 * payloads. Firestore document schemas are intentionally not exposed to the SDK.
 *
 * Type categories:
 * 1. Ad Format Types - Format identifiers and enums
 * 2. Format-Specific Configurations - Config shapes for each format
 * 3. ResolvedAd - The main ad payload type
 * 4. Request/Event Payloads - API communication types
 * 5. Internal SDK types - Config and state management
